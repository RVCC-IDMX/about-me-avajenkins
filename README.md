## Descripton
The About Me Project is a showcase of my skills learned in webpage development over the course of time and practice. Practicing incorporating CSS with HTML helps me make keep the website creative and organized.

### Skills Learned
HTML: Over time I learned how to use HTML to format my website and inserting its neccessities. This includes the header, body, and making different sections which will help when later inserting CSS work. I also learned how to insert images properly and how to size them such as my logo. One of the trickier skills I've learned too is my video in the video section. Many properties go along with the element to ensure it performs properly which is why it is important to pay attention to any tutorial showing you how to insert such embedded media.

CSS: In this course, my knowledge of CSS has grown since the course I took in highschool. There is a whole world of measurements and little elements in CSS. I was glad to learn get comfortable with px, rem, and em measurements. As well as using padding, border, width, height, and etc.. a lot for all different sections used throughout this website.
