## Descripton
The About Me Project is a showcase of my skills learned in webpage development over the course of time and practice. Practicing incorporating CSS with HTML helps me make keep the website creative and organized.

### Skills Learned
HTML: Over time I learned how to use HTML to format my website and inserting its neccessities. This includes the header, body, and making different sections which will help when later inserting CSS work. I also learned how to insert images properly and how to size them such as my logo.

CSS: 

#### Color Schemes:

Primary Blue:
RGB: 98, 171, 210
Hex: #62abd2
Primary Purple:
RGB: 122, 100, 228
Hex: #7a64e4
Accent Green:

These color schemes give the viewer an eccentric feeling to the website almost as a futuristic game made in the 1980s. The harmonious shades of blue and purple with an accent and outline color of bright green to really accentuate the features.
